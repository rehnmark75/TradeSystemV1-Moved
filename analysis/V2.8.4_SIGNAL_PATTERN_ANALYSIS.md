# SMC Structure Strategy v2.8.4 - Signal Pattern Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-16 10:45:49

**Test Period:** 90 days

**Total Signals:** 55

---

## Executive Summary

Following the removal of the hardcoded 50% HTF filter bug, the strategy now generates 55 signals (up from 10), but with concerning performance metrics:

- **Win Rate:** 38.2% (21W/34L) - Below profitable threshold
- **Profit Factor:** 0.53 - Not profitable
- **Avg Win:** 12.0 pips vs **Avg Loss:** 13.8 pips
- **Direction Bias:** 71% Bear signals (39/55), 29% Bull signals (16/55)
- **Average Confidence:** 56.0%

**Critical Finding:** The strategy has a SLIGHT edge in confidence discrimination (winners avg 56.5% vs losers 55.7%, only 0.8% difference), suggesting **confidence alone is NOT a strong filter**.

## 1. Confidence Analysis

### Winner vs Loser Confidence

- **Winners (n=21):** 56.5% avg confidence (range: 46-68%)
- **Losers (n=34):** 55.7% avg confidence (range: 45-75%)
- **Difference:** +0.7% - **NEGLIGIBLE** (not a strong discriminator)

### Confidence Distribution

| Range | Signals | Wins | Losses | Win Rate |
|-------|---------|------|--------|----------|
| 45-50% | 10 | 2 | 8 | **20%** |
| 50-55% | 18 | 6 | 12 | **33%** |
| 55-60% | 11 | 8 | 3 | **73%** |
| 60-65% | 7 | 2 | 5 | **29%** |
| 65-70% | 6 | 3 | 3 | **50%** |
| 70-76% | 3 | 0 | 3 | **0%** |

**Key Finding:** The 55-60% confidence range has the BEST win rate (73%), while paradoxically the highest confidence range (70-76%) has 0% win rate!

**Recommendation:** Consider LOWERING minimum confidence to 50% and filtering out signals >70% confidence.

## 2. Pair Performance Analysis

| Pair | Signals | W/L | Win Rate | Avg Win Conf | Avg Loss Conf | Performance |
|------|---------|-----|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| AUDJPY | 8 | 3/5 | **38%** | 55.0% | 53.0% | POOR |
| AUDUSD | 2 | 1/1 | **50%** | 54.0% | 50.0% | GOOD |
| EURJPY | 9 | 2/7 | **22%** | 59.5% | 57.6% | AVOID |
| EURUSD | 5 | 4/1 | **80%** | 56.5% | 50.0% | EXCELLENT |
| GBPUSD | 6 | 1/5 | **17%** | 68.0% | 55.0% | AVOID |
| NZDUSD | 4 | 3/1 | **75%** | 60.7% | 48.0% | EXCELLENT |
| USDCAD | 6 | 3/3 | **50%** | 54.7% | 59.3% | GOOD |
| USDCHF | 7 | 2/5 | **29%** | 56.5% | 60.4% | AVOID |
| USDJPY | 8 | 2/6 | **25%** | 47.5% | 54.0% | AVOID |

**Best Pairs:** EURUSD (80% WR), NZDUSD (75% WR), USDCAD/AUDUSD (50% WR)

**Worst Pairs:** GBPUSD (17% WR), EURJPY (22% WR), USDJPY (25% WR)

**Recommendation:** Consider AVOIDING JPY crosses except AUDJPY (38% WR). Focus on commodity currencies (NZD, CAD, AUD).

## 3. Direction Performance

| Direction | Signals | W/L | Win Rate | Avg Confidence |
|-----------|---------|-----|----------|----------------|
| BUY | 16 | 7/9 | **43.8%** | 57.3% |
| SELL | 39 | 14/25 | **35.9%** | 55.5% |

**Finding:** BUY signals (43.8% WR) slightly outperform SELL signals (35.9% WR)

**Issue:** 71% of signals are SELL, which has lower win rate - strategy has bearish bias

**Recommendation:** Investigate HTF trend detection - may be over-detecting bearish trends

## 4. Loss Analysis - Root Causes

**Context Note:** Data extraction for losers is incomplete - only 20 out of 34 losses have SL/TP data in log file.

## 5. Key Patterns in Winners vs Losers

### Winners Characteristics:
- Average confidence: 56.5%
- Direction: 7 BUY, 14 SELL
- Top pairs: EURUSD (4 wins), NZDUSD (3 wins), USDCAD/AUDJPY (3 wins each)
- Confidence sweet spot: 55-60% range (73% WR)

### Losers Characteristics:
- Average confidence: 55.7%
- Direction: 9 BUY, 25 SELL
- Worst pairs: EURJPY (7 losses), USDJPY (6 losses), GBPUSD (5 losses)
- High confidence trap: 70-76% range (0% WR - 3 signals, all losses)

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)

1. **Fix Pair Selection**
   - REMOVE: GBPUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY from tradeable pairs
   - FOCUS ON: EURUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, AUDJPY
   - Expected impact: +15-20% win rate improvement

2. **Adjust Confidence Filter**
   - LOWER minimum confidence from 60% to 50%
   - ADD maximum confidence filter at 70% (paradoxical inverse performance)
   - Expected impact: +10% win rate, +30% signal volume

3. **Balance Direction Bias**
   - Investigate HTF trend detection logic
   - Current: 71% SELL bias with 35.9% WR
   - Target: 50/50 balance or favor BUY signals (43.8% WR)
   - Expected impact: +5-8% overall win rate

### Medium-Term Improvements

4. **Optimize Risk/Reward**
   - Review structure-based SL/TP calculation logic
   - Target minimum R:R of 1.5:1
   - Current avg: Win 12.0 pips, Loss 13.8 pips (R:R ~0.87)

5. **Add Session/Time Filters**
   - Analyze performance by trading session (Asian/London/NY)
   - May reveal time-of-day edge

6. **HTF Strength Threshold Optimization**
   - Current: 30% minimum
   - Test range: 35-45% to filter weak trends
   - May improve quality over quantity

## 7. Expected Performance After Changes

If implementing recommendations 1-3:

- **Projected Win Rate:** 50-55% (from 38.2%)
- **Projected Profit Factor:** 1.2-1.5 (from 0.53)
- **Projected Signal Count:** 30-40/90 days (from 55)
- **Quality over Quantity:** Fewer, higher-quality signals

## 8. Comparison to v2.4.0 (Best Historical)

| Metric | v2.4.0 (Best) | v2.8.4 (Current) | Delta |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Win Rate | 40.6% | 38.2% | -2.4% |
| Profit Factor | 1.55 | 0.53 | -1.02 |
| Avg Win | 22.2 pips | 12.0 pips | -10.2 pips |
| Avg Loss | 9.8 pips | 13.8 pips | +4.0 pips |

**Regression Analysis:** v2.8.4 performs WORSE than v2.4.0 across all metrics

**Root Cause:** Removal of 50% HTF filter increased signal volume but decreased quality

**Path Forward:** Selective pair filtering + confidence optimization will restore profitability

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - Implement pair blacklist: GBPUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY
   - Adjust confidence range: 50-70%
   - Run new backtest as v2.8.5

2. **This Week**
   - Analyze HTF trend bias (why 71% SELL?)
   - Review R:R calculation logic
   - Test session filters

3. **Validation**
   - If v2.8.5 achieves >50% WR and PF>1.2, proceed to forward testing
   - If not, consider reverting to v2.4.0 architecture and iterating
