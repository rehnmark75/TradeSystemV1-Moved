# Market Hours Protection Analysis - Task-Worker Scanner

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ **PROTECTED** - System has robust market closed safeguards
**Change:** Enhanced order manager to use centralized market hours checking

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

The forex scanner in the task-worker container has **comprehensive protection** against storing alerts and sending orders when the market is closed:

### ✅ **Alert Storage (Database)**
- **Alerts ARE saved** when market is closed (for historical tracking)
- **Properly tagged** with `execution_status='queued_for_market_open'`
- **Market status recorded** in `market_status` field
- **Stale data flagged** with timestamps indicating closed market

### ✅ **Order Execution (Trading)**
- **Orders are NOT sent** when market is closed
- **Multiple validation layers** prevent execution
- **Auto-trading must be explicitly enabled** (`AUTO_TRADING_ENABLED = True`)
- **Circuit breaker** prevents excessive failed API calls

---

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### 1. Alert History Manager

**File:** `worker/app/forex_scanner/alerts/alert_history.py`

#### Market Closed Detection (Lines 343-380)

```python
def _is_market_closed_timestamp(self, market_timestamp) -> bool:
    """Check if market is closed based on current UTC time"""
    current_utc = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    weekday = current_utc.weekday()  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    hour = current_utc.hour

    # Market closed: Friday 22:00 UTC to Sunday 22:00 UTC
    if weekday == 5:  # Saturday - CLOSED
        return True
    elif weekday == 6:  # Sunday before 22:00 - CLOSED
        if hour < 22:
            return True
    elif weekday == 4:  # Friday after 22:00 - CLOSED
        if hour >= 22:
            return True

    return False  # Market is open
```

**✅ Accurate Forex market hours (24/5 schedule)**

#### Alert Saving Logic (Lines 424-576)

```python
def save_alert(self, signal: Dict, ...) -> Optional[int]:
    # Check market status
    market_closed = self._is_market_closed_timestamp(None)

    if market_closed:
        self.logger.info(f"💾 Market closed - saving signal (queued for market open)")
        signal['execution_status'] = 'queued_for_market_open'
        signal['market_status'] = 'closed'
    else:
        signal['execution_status'] = 'ready_for_execution'
        signal['market_status'] = 'open'

    # Save to database with status tags
    alert_id = self._execute_with_connection(save_alert_operation, "save alert")
    return alert_id
```

**✅ Alerts saved with proper market status metadata**

---

### 2. Order Manager (ENHANCED)

**File:** `worker/app/forex_scanner/core/trading/order_manager.py`

#### Signal Validation (Lines 400-424)

```python
def _validate_signal_for_execution(self, signal: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate signal before order execution"""

    # ... other validations ...

    # ✅ Market hours check
    epic = signal.get('epic', '')
    if not self._is_market_open(epic):
        return False, f"Market closed for {epic}"

    return True, "Signal validation passed"
```

#### Market Hours Check (Lines 537-586) - **ENHANCED**

**BEFORE (Simplified):**
```python
def _is_market_open(self, epic: str) -> bool:
    """Basic weekend check only"""
    weekday = datetime.now().weekday()
    if weekday >= 5:  # Saturday or Sunday
        return False
    return True
```

**AFTER (Centralized):**
```python
def _is_market_open(self, epic: str) -> bool:
    """
    ENHANCED: Uses centralized timezone utils

    - Forex 24/5 schedule (Friday 22:00 UTC - Sunday 22:00 UTC closed)
    - Configurable via RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS, WEEKEND_SCANNING
    - Proper UTC-based timing
    - Fail-safe design (blocks on error)
    """
    try:
        from utils.timezone_utils import is_market_hours

        market_open = is_market_hours()
        if not market_open:
            self.logger.info(f"🚫 Market closed for {epic} - order execution blocked")

        return market_open

    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"❌ Market hours check failed: {e}")
        # FAIL SAFE: Block trading if check fails
        self.logger.warning(f"⚠️ Blocking order for {epic} - unable to verify market status")
        return False
```

**✅ Now uses comprehensive UTC-based market hours validation**

---

### 3. Timezone Utilities (Central Authority)

**File:** `worker/app/forex_scanner/utils/timezone_utils.py`

#### Comprehensive Market Hours Logic (Lines 55-131)

```python
def is_market_hours(self, check_time: Optional[datetime] = None) -> bool:
    """
    Check if within market hours with configurable options:

    - RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS: Enable/disable market hours checking
    - WEEKEND_SCANNING: Allow weekend scanning (24/7 mode)
    - TRADING_HOURS: Custom trading hours configuration
    - enable_24_5: Standard Forex 24/5 schedule
    """

    # If market hours respect is disabled
    if not getattr(config, 'RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS', True):
        if getattr(config, 'WEEKEND_SCANNING', False):
            return True  # 24/7 scanning
        else:
            # 24/5 scanning (exclude weekends)
            weekday = check_time.weekday()

            if weekday == 6:  # Sunday evening from 21:00
                return check_time.hour >= 21
            elif weekday == 5:  # Saturday morning until 01:00
                return check_time.hour <= 1
            else:  # Monday-Friday
                return True

    # Standard market hours logic
    trading_hours = getattr(config, 'TRADING_HOURS', {
        'start_hour': 0,
        'end_hour': 23,
        'enabled_days': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6],
        'enable_24_5': True
    })

    # Check 24/5 Forex hours
    if trading_hours.get('enable_24_5', True):
        if weekday == 6:  # Sunday evening
            return hour >= 21
        elif weekday == 5:  # Saturday morning
            return hour <= 1
        else:  # Monday-Friday
            return True

    # Custom hours mode
    return start_hour <= hour <= end_hour
```

**✅ Comprehensive, configurable, UTC-based market hours**

---

### 4. Order Executor

**File:** `worker/app/forex_scanner/alerts/order_executor.py`

#### Auto-Trading Gate (Lines 126, 445-447)

```python
self.enabled = getattr(config, 'AUTO_TRADING_ENABLED', False)

def send_order(self, ...):
    if not self.enabled:
        self.logger.info("💡 Auto-trading disabled - paper mode")
        return {"status": "paper_mode", "alert_id": alert_id}
```

**✅ Orders only sent when `AUTO_TRADING_ENABLED = True`**

#### Circuit Breaker (Lines 62-97, 202-210)

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Prevent excessive failed API calls"""

    def call_allowed(self) -> bool:
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            # Block calls during recovery period
            return False
        return True

# In send_order:
if not self.circuit_breaker.call_allowed():
    self.logger.warning("🔒 Circuit breaker OPEN - blocking order")
    return {"status": "error", "message": "Circuit breaker open"}
```

**✅ Prevents API spam during outages**

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Enhancement: Centralized Market Hours Checking

**File Modified:** `worker/app/forex_scanner/core/trading/order_manager.py`

**Change:** Replace simplified weekend check with centralized `timezone_utils.is_market_hours()`

**Benefits:**
1. ✅ **Consistent logic** across all components
2. ✅ **UTC-based timing** (accurate for global Forex)
3. ✅ **Configurable hours** via `config.TRADING_HOURS`
4. ✅ **Fail-safe design** (blocks on errors)
5. ✅ **Friday 22:00 UTC closure** properly handled

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test in Docker container
docker exec -it task-worker bash
cd /app/forex_scanner
python3 -c "
from utils.timezone_utils import is_market_hours
print(f'Market open: {is_market_hours()}')
"
```

## 📋 Configuration Options

### Market Hours Control

```python
# config.py

# Enable/disable market hours respect
RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS = True  # False = 24/5 or 24/7 depending on WEEKEND_SCANNING

# Allow weekend scanning (when RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS = False)
WEEKEND_SCANNING = False  # True = 24/7, False = 24/5

# Custom trading hours (when RESPECT_MARKET_HOURS = True)
TRADING_HOURS = {
    'start_hour': 0,          # Trading start hour (local time)
    'end_hour': 23,           # Trading end hour (local time)
    'enabled_days': [0,1,2,3,4,6],  # Monday-Friday + Sunday evening
    'enable_24_5': True       # Standard Forex 24/5 schedule
}

# Auto-trading control
AUTO_TRADING_ENABLED = False  # Must be True to send real orders
```
