Signal Type: BUY
Price: 1.355565
Confidence: 76.6%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the strong bullish EMA alignment, the entry price sits precariously close to resistance (1.7 pips) with significantly more downside to support, creating an unfavorable risk-reward scenario. The bearish MACD crossover combined with price positioning at 81.7% of the range suggests exhaustion of the bullish momentum, while the low ATR indicates reduced volatility that could limit profit potential during the typically volatile London session.
