CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the high volume and bullish EMA alignment on lower timeframes, the position's risk/reward is suboptimal with resistance only 7.2 pips away versus support at 14.7 pips, creating an unfavorable 0.49:1 R:R ratio. Additionally, the weak MACD momentum (0.000042) combined with price being 67.2% through the current range suggests limited upside potential in this low volatility environment (ATR 0.00057), making this setup unsuitable for institutional capital deployment.
