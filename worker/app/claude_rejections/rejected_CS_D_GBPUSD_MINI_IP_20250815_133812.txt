CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment and high volume conviction, the entry price sits at 77% of the current range, presenting unfavorable risk/reward near immediate resistance (1.35699). The low ATR (0.00073) suggests insufficient volatility for meaningful profit potential, while the weak MACD histogram (0.000013) indicates momentum may be insufficient to break the nearby resistance level effectively.
