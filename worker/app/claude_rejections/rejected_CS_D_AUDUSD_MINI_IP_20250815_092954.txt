Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Signal Type: BEAR

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: While high volume (82.0 ratio) suggests strong conviction, the contradictory signals between short-term bullish EMAs and the bearish signal create an unfavorable setup. Price positioning at 63.7% within a narrow 13.5 pip range during London session, combined with weak MACD momentum (-0.000006), indicates potential trap formation rather than a clear directional opportunity. Risk/reward is compromised by tight range conditions and proximity to resistance at 0.65146.
