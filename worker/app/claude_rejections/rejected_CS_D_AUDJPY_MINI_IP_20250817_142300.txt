Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume, this bearish signal presents significant counter-trend risk against a perfectly aligned bullish EMA structure. The minimal EMA separation (0.6-0.9 pips) during London session suggests potential choppy price action rather than a clear reversal setup, while the neutral RSI fails to confirm oversold conditions that would support a counter-trend entry. Risk/reward profile is suboptimal for institutional position sizing in current market context.

Raw Response:
