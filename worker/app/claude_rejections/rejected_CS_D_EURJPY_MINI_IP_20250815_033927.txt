CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bearish EMA alignment and momentum, the position sits in mid-range during Tokyo session with moderate liquidity, presenting suboptimal risk/reward. The 57.2% range position suggests potential mean reversion risks, while the relatively tight EMA separations (5.6 and 9.3 pips) indicate weak trend conviction for institutional positioning. Volume analysis shows standard conviction, insufficient for major directional bias during lower liquidity conditions.
