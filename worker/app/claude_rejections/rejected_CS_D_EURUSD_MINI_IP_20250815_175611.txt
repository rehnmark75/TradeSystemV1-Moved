Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 17:56:11
Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 1.17055
Confidence: 77.8%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment, the signal presents concerning conflicting indicators with MACD showing bearish momentum and price positioned at 98.4% of its range (extreme proximity to resistance). The low ATR (0.00079) suggests insufficient volatility for optimal risk/reward, while the bearish MACD crossover contradicts the proposed long position. Entry timing appears suboptimal given the technical confluence of bearish signals and position relative to key levels.
