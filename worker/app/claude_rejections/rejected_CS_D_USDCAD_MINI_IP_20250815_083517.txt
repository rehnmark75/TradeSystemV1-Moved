Confidence: 89.0%

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the high system confidence (89%) and strong volume conviction, the conflicting technical signals raise concerns. The short-term bearish trend structure (EMA 9<21) contradicts the proposed bullish direction, while price action remains trapped in consolidation (inside EMA cloud) with weak momentum (MACD 0.000020). The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00034) combined with range-bound conditions suggests suboptimal risk/reward for directional positioning at this juncture.
