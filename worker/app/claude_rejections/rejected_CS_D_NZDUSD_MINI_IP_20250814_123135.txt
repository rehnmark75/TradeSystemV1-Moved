CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMA alignment and high volume conviction, the mid-range price position (48.7%) combined with weak MACD momentum (-0.000044) suggests insufficient institutional-grade directional bias. The relatively tight range (21.6 pips) and low ATR (0.00054) indicate compressed volatility conditions, which typically precede a volatility expansion - making immediate directional plays risky without clear range breakout confirmation.
