CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA alignment, entry price is positioned dangerously close to immediate resistance (0.5 pips) with significantly larger distance to support (8.8 pips), creating an unfavorable risk-reward setup. The combination of weak bearish MACD momentum, neutral RSI, and price location at 94.6% of the current range suggests high probability of rejection, particularly during volatile London session. Low ATR indicates reduced momentum for sustained breakout, making this an inefficient risk allocation opportunity from an institutional perspective.
