CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMAs, the current price action shows conflicting signals with price near support (16% from level) and bullish MACD crossover, suggesting potential reversal risk. The extremely tight range (2.5 pips) combined with low volatility (ATR: 0.00040) indicates poor risk/reward for institutional position sizing. Market structure suggests we're in a low-conviction environment where aggressive directional plays lack institutional-grade setup quality.
