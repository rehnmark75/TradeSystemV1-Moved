Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume, this signal presents significant concerns as a counter-trend trade against perfect EMA alignment in a bullish structure. The minor bearish MACD divergence and neutral RSI (50.0) don't provide sufficient conviction for institutional capital deployment, especially during high-volatility London hours. Risk/reward profile is suboptimal given the potential for strong bullish continuation based on trend structure.
