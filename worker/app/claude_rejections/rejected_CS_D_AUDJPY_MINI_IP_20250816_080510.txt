CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume confirmation (736.0), the conflicting trend signals (short-term bullish EMAs vs bearish price action) create an ambiguous trading environment. The position's location at 68.5% within the current range, combined with high volatility (ATR: 0.05826) and minimal EMA separation (0.9 pips), suggests increased reversal risk and suboptimal risk/reward at this entry point.
