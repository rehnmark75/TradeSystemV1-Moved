CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bearish alignment of EMAs and high volume indicating institutional participation, the mid-range position (59.3%) with relatively tight range (20.7 pips) during Tokyo session suggests insufficient directional conviction. The risk/reward is suboptimal given the proximity of resistance (8.4 pips) versus support (12.3 pips), and the weak MACD histogram (-0.000005) indicates momentum deterioration that doesn't support a compelling institutional-grade setup.
