CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA structure, the entry occurs in mid-range conditions with weak momentum (declining MACD) and relatively low volatility (ATR: 0.00073). The risk/reward is suboptimal given the tight range (6.5 pips) and proximity to resistance (2.4 pips), offering insufficient margin for institutional position sizing. The neutral RSI and standard volume metrics suggest lack of compelling institutional order flow to support a high-conviction entry.

Raw Response:
