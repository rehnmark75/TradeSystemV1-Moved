Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the strong bearish EMA alignment, the mid-range positioning (52.9%) combined with neutral RSI and conflicting MACD signals presents an ambiguous setup with suboptimal risk/reward. The high volatility environment (ATR: 0.12743) during overlapping sessions increases execution risk, while the tight EMA separation (0.18%) suggests a transitioning market regime rather than a definitive trend continuation opportunity.
