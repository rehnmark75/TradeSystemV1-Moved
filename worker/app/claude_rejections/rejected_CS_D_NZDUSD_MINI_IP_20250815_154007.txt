CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the high system confidence (95%), multiple technical factors raise concerns: price is trapped in EMA cloud with minimal separation (3.3-10.6 pips), suggesting weak trend momentum, while volume is significantly below average (0.25 ratio) indicating lack of institutional conviction. The risk/reward setup is particularly unfavorable given the current mid-range position (45.9%) with price showing minimal directional bias, combined with low ATR conditions that typically lead to choppy price action and increased execution risk.
