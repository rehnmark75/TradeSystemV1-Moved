CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the strong bullish EMA alignment, the entry price is positioned extremely close to immediate resistance (0.3 pips) with significantly larger distance to support (6.6 pips), creating a poor risk-reward scenario. The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00053) combined with price being 95.7% through the current range suggests limited upside potential, while MACD shows bearish divergence. The confluence of these factors indicates high probability of rejection at current levels.
