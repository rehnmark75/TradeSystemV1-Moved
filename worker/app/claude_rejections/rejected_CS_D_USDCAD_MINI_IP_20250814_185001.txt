Confidence: 78.2%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment suggesting an uptrend, the combination of bearish MACD crossover, mid-range price location, and notably low volatility (ATR: 0.00075) presents suboptimal entry conditions for institutional capital deployment. The narrow 6.3 pip range and weak trending conditions (0.26% EMA separation) indicate potential choppy price action, while the risk/reward profile is compromised by tight level spacing and absence of clear institutional order flow signals.
