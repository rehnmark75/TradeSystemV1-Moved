Price: 1.3566449999999999
Confidence: 77.1%

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment, the entry is positioned at 96.4% of the current range and practically touching resistance (0.3 pips away), presenting a poor risk/reward scenario. The combination of weak MACD momentum, bearish MACD crossover, and neutral RSI in a low-volatility environment suggests insufficient momentum to break resistance, making this a high-risk entry point with limited upside potential in the current market regime.
