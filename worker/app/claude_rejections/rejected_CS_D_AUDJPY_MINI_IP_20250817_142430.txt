Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-17 14:24:30
Epic: CS.D.AUDJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BEAR
Price: 95.7655
Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high volume and clear bearish momentum indicators, this signal presents significant risk as a counter-trend setup against a strong bullish EMA structure. The minimal EMA separation (0.9 and 0.6 pips) coupled with neutral RSI suggests potential market indecision rather than a decisive reversal opportunity. The risk/reward profile is suboptimal for institutional capital deployment, particularly during high volatility London session conditions.
