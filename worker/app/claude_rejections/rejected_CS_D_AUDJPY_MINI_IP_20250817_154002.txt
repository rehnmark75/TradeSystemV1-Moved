Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-17 15:40:02
Epic: CS.D.AUDJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BEAR
Price: 95.7655
Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume, this bearish signal presents significant risk as it counters the dominant bullish trend structure (perfect EMA alignment). The minimal EMA separation (0.8-0.9 pips) suggests a compressed range that could lead to violent breakouts, while executing counter-trend during London session volatility amplifies risk. Risk/reward profile is suboptimal given current market conditions and technical positioning.
