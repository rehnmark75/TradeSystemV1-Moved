CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: This sell signal presents significant concerns from an institutional perspective. The price is currently in mid-range with conflicting signals (short-term bullish EMAs vs bearish territory), while the exceptionally low volume ratio (0.35) indicates lack of institutional participation. The risk/reward is particularly unfavorable given the closer proximity to resistance (5.5 pips) versus support (10.0 pips), combined with low volatility during Tokyo session.

Raw Response:

This assessment focuses on capital preservation given the unclear directional bias and poor trading location. From an institutional risk management perspective, better setups with clearer order flow and stronger volume confirmation should be prioritized.
