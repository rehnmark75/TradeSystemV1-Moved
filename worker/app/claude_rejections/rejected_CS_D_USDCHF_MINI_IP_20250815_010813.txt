Epic: CS.D.USDCHF.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 0.80791
Confidence: 76.9%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, the extremely tight range (4.3 pips) combined with low volatility during Tokyo session presents unfavorable risk/reward dynamics for institutional capital deployment. The MACD shows minimal momentum (0.000016) and price is sitting at 65% of the current range, suggesting potential exhaustion of the immediate bullish move. Current market conditions don't meet institutional standards for position initiation.
