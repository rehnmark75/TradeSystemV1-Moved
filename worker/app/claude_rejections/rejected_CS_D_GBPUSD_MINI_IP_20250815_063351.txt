CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment and high volume, the entry price sits dangerously close to immediate resistance (0.7 pips) with price positioned 97.9% up within its range, creating an unfavorable risk/reward scenario. The low volatility environment during Tokyo session combined with weak MACD momentum suggests limited upside potential, while the proximity to resistance increases rejection risk. Professional capital deployment would be more efficient waiting for a pullback or clearer setup with better risk/reward characteristics.
