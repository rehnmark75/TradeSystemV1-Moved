CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment suggesting trend strength, the contradictory signals from MACD's bearish crossover and momentum coupled with mid-range positioning raise significant concerns about trade conviction. The risk/reward setup is particularly unfavorable with price sitting closer to support than resistance (36.5% from support), while high volatility (ATR: 0.09626) and normal volume metrics fail to provide compelling evidence of institutional participation at these levels.
