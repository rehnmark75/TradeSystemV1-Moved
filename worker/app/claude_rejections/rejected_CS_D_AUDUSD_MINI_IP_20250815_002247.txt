CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMA alignment and high volume conviction, the mid-range positioning (59.3%) during Tokyo session's reduced liquidity presents suboptimal entry conditions for institutional capital deployment. The relatively tight range (20.7 pips) combined with low volatility (ATR: 0.00034) suggests insufficient momentum for meaningful price expansion, while the weak MACD histogram (-0.000008) indicates potential momentum divergence that could trap large position sizes.
