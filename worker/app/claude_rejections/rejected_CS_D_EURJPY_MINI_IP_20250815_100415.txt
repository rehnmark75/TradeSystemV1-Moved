Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 10:04:15
Epic: CS.D.EURJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: SELL
Price: 171.6165
Confidence: 77.1%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the high system confidence, there are significant conflicting signals - notably the bearish trend structure against bullish MACD momentum and price positioning near support (10.9%). The wide range (1100 pips) combined with high volatility (ATR: 0.09715) creates unfavorable risk/reward for a SELL entry, especially during the volatile London session where whipsaw risk is elevated. The minimal EMA separation (0.16%) suggests choppy, range-bound conditions unsuitable for trend-following strategies.
