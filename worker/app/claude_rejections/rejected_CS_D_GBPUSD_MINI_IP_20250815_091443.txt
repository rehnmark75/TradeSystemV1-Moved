Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA alignment, the entry point at 1.35520 sits dangerously close to immediate resistance (0.4 pips away) with significantly more downside to support, creating an unfavorable risk-reward setup. The combination of weak bearish momentum (MACD), neutral RSI, and position at 93.9% of the current range suggests limited upside potential in the immediate term. Additionally, the low ATR indicates reduced volatility which typically leads to poorer execution quality and increased slippage risk during the typically volatile London session.
