Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence (86.5%), the conflicting trend structure (short-term bullish EMAs vs bearish signal) creates unfavorable risk/reward dynamics. Price positioning at 68.5% from support in a range-bound market with high volatility (ATR: 0.05826) suggests increased reversal risk. The bearish MACD crossover, while notable, lacks confluence with overall market structure and key level positioning.
