CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high volume and clear bearish momentum (MACD), the conflict between short-term bullish EMAs and current price position creates an ambiguous setup. The mid-range location (49%) with significant distance to both support/resistance levels (>1400 pips) suggests poor risk/reward optimization potential. Price sitting in a weak trending market with high volatility (ATR: 0.06751) increases execution risk without clear directional confirmation.
