CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bearish EMA alignment, the setup presents significant concerns during lower-liquidity Tokyo session with minimal volatility (ATR: 0.00052) and conflicting momentum signals (weak bullish MACD vs bearish structure). Current mid-range position (60.8%) with tight range (4.9 pips) suggests poor risk/reward, while the neutral RSI and standard volume provide insufficient conviction for institutional capital deployment.
