Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-17 15:24:55
Epic: CS.D.AUDJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BEAR
Price: 95.7655
Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high volume and system confidence, this bearish signal conflicts with the strong bullish trend structure (perfect EMA alignment) and presents unfavorable risk/reward in a range-bound market condition. The counter-trend positioning below EMAs during London session volatility, combined with relatively tight EMA separations (0.7-0.9 pips), suggests increased risk of whipsaw action rather than sustained directional movement.
