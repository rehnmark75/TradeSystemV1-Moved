Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 20:14:52
Epic: CS.D.EURJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 172.3315
Confidence: 78.6%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the strong bullish EMA alignment, the position is extremely close to resistance (97.8% of range) with bearish MACD momentum divergence, creating an unfavorable risk/reward setup. The high volatility (ATR: 0.09225) combined with price location near range ceiling suggests increased reversal risk, while the bearish MACD crossover signals potential momentum shift that contradicts the proposed long entry.
