Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Signal Type: BUY
Price: 1.355205
Confidence: 75.5%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, the extremely tight EMA separations (0.3-2.4 pips) combined with low ATR suggests a lack of directional momentum and potential for whipsaws. The mid-range position (60.9%) with neutral RSI and bearish MACD crossover presents insufficient conviction for institutional capital deployment, especially during typically volatile London hours where clearer setups should be prioritized.
