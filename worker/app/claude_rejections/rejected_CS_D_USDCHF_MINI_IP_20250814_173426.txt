Signal Type: BUY
Price: 0.80844
Confidence: 78.5%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, the extremely low volatility (ATR 0.00078) combined with weak momentum (MACD 0.000006) suggests poor reward potential relative to execution risk. The mid-range position (61.7%) with narrow range boundaries (6.0 pips) indicates potential consolidation, while the neutral RSI and standard volume provide no compelling institutional-grade confirmation for directional bias at this price point.
