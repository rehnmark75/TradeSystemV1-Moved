Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-14 21:51:31
Epic: CS.D.EURJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 172.1465
Confidence: 76.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, the conflicting signals between trend structure and momentum indicators (bearish MACD crossover) suggest potential trend exhaustion. The mid-range position (55.6%) with relatively tight range bounds (630 pips) in a high volatility environment (ATR: 0.08594) presents suboptimal risk/reward, especially during NY session where false breaks are common. Position sizing would need to be significantly reduced given the market context, making the trade inefficient from a capital deployment perspective.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this through an institutional lens:
