Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BEAR
Price: 1.168225
Confidence: 92.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the high system confidence and favorable session timing (London/NY overlap), the technical setup presents concerning contradictions. The minimal EMA separations (1.8 and 0.7 pips) combined with low ATR (0.00083) suggest a compressed range environment where breakout signals often fail. While volume is notably high, the neutral RSI and weak MACD histogram (-0.000011) indicate insufficient momentum to justify institutional capital deployment at this level.
