Confidence: 80.5%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bearish EMA alignment, the extremely tight range (6.1 pips) combined with the price's proximity to support (0.6 pips) creates an unfavorable risk-reward scenario for institutional positioning. The weak MACD momentum (-0.000013) and neutral RSI suggest insufficient conviction for a sustained move, while the low ATR (0.00064) indicates compressed volatility that typically precedes potential reversals - making this setup suboptimal for institutional capital deployment.
