Price: 1.170805
Confidence: 79.0%

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA alignment, the entry price sits directly beneath immediate resistance (0.3 pips away) with MACD showing bearish momentum divergence, creating an unfavorable risk/reward scenario. The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00077) combined with price positioning at 96.1% of the current range suggests limited upside potential, while the proximity to resistance increases rejection risk.
