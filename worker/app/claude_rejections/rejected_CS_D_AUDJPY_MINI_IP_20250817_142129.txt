Signal Type: BEAR
Price: 95.7655
Confidence: 85.0%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high volume and system confidence, this bearish signal presents significant risk as it counters the strong bullish trend structure (perfect EMA alignment) in a high-volatility environment. The minimal EMA separation (0.9/0.6 pips) suggests potential whipsaw conditions, while the neutral RSI (50.0) fails to provide convincing downside confirmation for institutional position sizing requirements.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key technical and risk factors:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Despite high volume and system confidence, this bearish signal presents significant risk as it counters the strong bullish trend structure (perfect EMA alignment) in a high-volatility environment. The minimal EMA separation (0.9/0.6 pips) suggests potential whipsaw conditions, while the neutral RSI (50.0) fails to provide convincing downside confirmation for institutional position sizing requirements.

This conservative rejection stems from institutional risk standards where trend-counter positions require exceptional confirmation factors, which are not present in the current setup.
