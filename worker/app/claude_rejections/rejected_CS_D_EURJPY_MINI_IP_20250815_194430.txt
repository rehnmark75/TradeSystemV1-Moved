Epic: CS.D.EURJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 172.2825
Confidence: 77.1%

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment, the signal presents significant concerns: price is positioned 78.3% towards resistance in a range-bound market with bearish MACD momentum, creating unfavorable risk/reward. The high ATR (0.09474) combined with position near range ceiling suggests increased reversal risk. Additional caution warranted due to conflicting signals between trend structure and momentum indicators.
