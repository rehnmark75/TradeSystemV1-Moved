Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 06:25:57
Epic: CS.D.USDCHF.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BULL
Price: 0.806675
Confidence: 76.5%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the bullish signal and high volume, the current price action shows conflicting signals with weak momentum (MACD 0.000002) and neutral RSI in a low volatility environment during Asian session. The technical structure presents increased risk with price trapped in EMA cloud while showing bearish short-term bias (EMA 9<21), suggesting potential institutional order blocks above. Risk/reward profile is suboptimal for institutional capital deployment at this juncture.
