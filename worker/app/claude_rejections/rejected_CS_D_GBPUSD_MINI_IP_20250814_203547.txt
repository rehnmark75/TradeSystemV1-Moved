Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-14 20:35:47
Epic: CS.D.GBPUSD.MINI.IP
Signal Type: SELL
Price: 1.3532950000000001
Confidence: 76.7%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMA alignment, the proposed SELL signal conflicts with multiple key factors: price is sitting at immediate support (1.35325), MACD shows strong bullish momentum with a fresh crossover, and the small range (4.1 pips) suggests insufficient volatility for institutional position sizing. The risk/reward is particularly unfavorable given the compressed price action and proximity to support, making this unsuitable for institutional capital deployment.

Raw Response:
