CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume, the conflicting signals between short-term bullish EMAs and bearish MACD crossover create an ambiguous setup. The position's location at 68.5% from support in a range-bound market suggests limited downside potential, while the risk/reward ratio appears unfavorable given the distance to nearest support. Institutional execution would be better served waiting for clearer directional alignment of EMAs and price action.
