Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Signal Type: SELL
Price: 1.353135
Confidence: 76.2%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the system's 76.2% confidence, multiple concerning factors emerge: price is extremely close to support (0.2 pips) with minimal EMA separation (0.1 pips), suggesting weak trend conviction. The low volatility Tokyo session combined with neutral RSI and conflicting momentum signals (weak bullish MACD vs bearish EMAs) presents poor risk/reward characteristics for institutional capital deployment. A professional setup requires clearer directional bias and better risk/reward parameters.
