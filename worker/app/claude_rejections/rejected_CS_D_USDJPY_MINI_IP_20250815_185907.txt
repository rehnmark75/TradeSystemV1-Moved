Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 18:59:07
Epic: CS.D.USDJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: SELL
Price: 147.2195
Confidence: 95.0%
Strategy: zero_lag_ema_entry

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Signal exhibits significant technical contradictions - proposing a SELL while showing bullish momentum (positive MACD histogram and bullish crossover) and bullish short-term EMAs. The below-average volume (0.38 ratio) suggests weak conviction in current price action, while position at 53.1% of the range indicates no clear directional advantage. Despite high system confidence, the risk/reward setup is suboptimal given the current mid-range consolidation and mixed technical signals.
