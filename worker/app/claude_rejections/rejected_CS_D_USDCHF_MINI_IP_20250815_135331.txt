CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the system's high confidence (78.3%), the technical setup presents significant concerns. The proximity to support (2.2 pips) combined with a bullish MACD crossover contradicts the proposed sell direction, while the neutral RSI and low volatility (ATR: 0.00054) suggest limited downside potential. Risk/reward is particularly unfavorable with the nearest resistance being 9.0 pips away versus 2.2 pips to support, making this an inefficient trade setup from an institutional perspective.
