Claude Signal Rejection Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 06:33:55
Epic: CS.D.USDJPY.MINI.IP
Signal Type: SELL
Price: 147.1015
Confidence: 77.7%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite the system's high confidence (77.7%), there are significant technical contradictions that raise concerns. The signal suggests a SELL while showing strong bullish momentum (MACD), price positioning near support (19.7% from level), and we're in a ranging market during lower-liquidity Tokyo hours. The risk/reward profile is particularly unfavorable given the proximity to support and the large resistance distance, suggesting potential mean reversion against the proposed direction.
