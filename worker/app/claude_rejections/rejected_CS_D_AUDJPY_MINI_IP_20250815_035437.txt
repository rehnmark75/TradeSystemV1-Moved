Signal Type: SELL
Price: 95.709
Confidence: 79.5%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMAs and momentum indicators, the price is positioned dangerously close to support (15.7%) in a high volatility environment (ATR: 0.06326), creating an unfavorable risk-reward scenario for institutional short positions. The Tokyo session's lower liquidity combined with the current range dynamics suggests potential for a technical bounce, while the neutral RSI (50.0) fails to provide convincing confirmation for continuation of the bearish move at these levels.
