Claude Signal Rejection Analysis

Epic: CS.D.GBPUSD.MINI.IP
Signal Type: BUY
Price: 1.355835
Confidence: 75.7%
Strategy: combined

CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, the entry point is suboptimal with price positioned at 86.5% of the current range and only 2.0 pips from resistance, creating an unfavorable risk/reward scenario. The weak bearish momentum shown by MACD crossover, combined with neutral RSI and low volatility (ATR: 0.00061), suggests limited upside potential in the immediate term, particularly during a typically volatile London session where a pullback is more probable than a breakout from this position.
