CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite bullish EMA alignment, this setup presents significant concerns from an institutional perspective. Price is compressed near resistance (81% of range) with bearish momentum (MACD crossover), creating unfavorable risk/reward at current levels. The confluence of high volatility (ATR: 0.08893) and range-bound conditions during NY session suggests potential choppy price action, making precise entry and risk management challenging for institutional position sizing.
