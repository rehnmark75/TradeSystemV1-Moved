CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMA alignment, the position within the current range (26.1% from support) presents unfavorable risk/reward for institutional positioning. The conflicting signals between bearish trend structure and bullish MACD momentum, combined with Tokyo session's typically lower liquidity, create suboptimal execution conditions. Additionally, the relatively tight 555-pip range suggests potential consolidation rather than a clear directional opportunity suitable for institutional capital deployment.
