CLAUDE REJECTION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Reason: Signal presents significant concerns from an institutional perspective. The proposed SHORT entry conflicts with the short-term bullish structure (EMA alignment), while extremely low volume (0.18 ratio) indicates lack of institutional participation. Entry positioning at 69.6% of the range during low volatility Tokyo session suggests poor risk/reward, especially with closer resistance (10.3 pips) than support (23.6 pips).
