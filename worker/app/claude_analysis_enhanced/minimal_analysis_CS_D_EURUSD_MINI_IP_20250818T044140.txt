Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal presents insufficient technical context during low-liquidity Tokyo session, with entry positioning ahead of major session transitions (London/NY overlap) which typically introduces heightened volatility and potential whipsaws. While system confidence is high at 85%, the lack of clear market regime context and supporting technical confluence makes risk/reward suboptimal for institutional capital deployment at this juncture.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the critical elements:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal presents insufficient technical context during low-liquidity Tokyo session, with entry positioning ahead of major session transitions (London/NY overlap) which typically introduces heightened volatility and potential whipsaws. While system confidence is high at 85%, the lack of clear market regime context and supporting technical confluence makes risk/reward suboptimal for institutional capital deployment at this juncture.

I've assigned a low score and rejection primarily due to:
1. Timing risk (session transition)
2. Insufficient technical context
3. Poor risk/reward clarity for institutional position sizing

This conservative stance aligns with institutional risk management priorities, especially given the limited available analysis parameters.
