Signal: BULL
Price: 0.59364
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA alignment and high volume conviction, the entry is suboptimal with price positioned 87.7% up within its range and only 2.4 pips from resistance, creating an unfavorable risk/reward scenario. The weak MACD momentum (0.000014) during Tokyo session's lower liquidity environment, combined with the range-bound market regime (0.01% EMA separation), suggests limited upside potential against the immediate technical resistance.
