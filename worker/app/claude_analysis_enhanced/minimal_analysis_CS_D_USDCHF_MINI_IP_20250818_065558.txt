Epic: CS.D.USDCHF.MINI.IP
Signal: BEAR
Price: 0.806
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite strong bearish EMA alignment and high volume conviction, the mid-range positioning (48.3%) combined with low volatility (ATR: 0.00029) during Tokyo session suggests suboptimal entry conditions. Risk/reward is compromised by tight range conditions (20.3 pips) and weak MACD momentum (-0.000007), indicating potential for range-bound price action rather than sustained directional movement.
