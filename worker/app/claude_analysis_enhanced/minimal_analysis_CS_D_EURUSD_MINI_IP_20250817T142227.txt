Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is optimal for EUR/USD execution, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmatory data points needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is noteworthy, but without market regime analysis, order flow context, or key technical levels, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly quantified to institutional standards. High volatility expectations during overlap require more defensive positioning parameters than provided.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective:

Note: Additional price action context (recent swing highs/lows, key technical levels) and volatility metrics would be required for a more comprehensive institutional assessment.
