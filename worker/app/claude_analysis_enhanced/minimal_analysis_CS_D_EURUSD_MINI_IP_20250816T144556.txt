Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the high system confidence (85%) and favorable session timing during London/NY overlap, the signal lacks critical technical context and market regime data needed for institutional-grade position taking. The absence of clear support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and broader market context creates unacceptable execution risk, particularly for a major pair like EUR/USD where precision entry is crucial for maintaining positive expectancy.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Despite the high system confidence (85%) and favorable session timing during London/NY overlap, the signal lacks critical technical context and market regime data needed for institutional-grade position taking. The absence of clear support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and broader market context creates unacceptable execution risk, particularly for a major pair like EUR/USD where precision entry is crucial for maintaining positive expectancy.

Note: While the liquidity conditions are optimal, I would need to see comprehensive market structure analysis, key technical levels, and intermarket correlations before approving a position of institutional size. The risk parameters appear standard but aren't sufficiently detailed for proper position sizing calculations.
