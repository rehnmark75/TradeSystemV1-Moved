Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Entry proposal lacks critical technical confluence and comes during suboptimal Tokyo session liquidity conditions where spreads tend to be wider and price action less reliable. The 85% system confidence is undermined by insufficient market context data and absence of clear regime analysis, making risk/reward assessment problematic. Additionally, major pairs during pre-London hours often exhibit false breakouts and whipsaw movements that could compromise execution quality.

Raw Response:
