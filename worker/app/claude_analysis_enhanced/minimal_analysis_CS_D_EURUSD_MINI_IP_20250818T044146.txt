Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal presents insufficient technical context during the relatively illiquid Tokyo session, with no clear market regime analysis or momentum indicators to validate the 85% system confidence. Entry at 1.12340 lacks critical support/resistance context and comes at a suboptimal timing before the more liquid London/NY crossover, suggesting potential slippage and execution risks that could compromise the risk/reward profile.

Raw Response:

My institutional perspective highlights several red flags:
- System confidence seems arbitrarily high without supporting evidence
- Timing during lower-volume Asian session increases execution risk
- Missing key technical context makes proper position sizing difficult
- No clear catalyst or momentum confirmation
- Risk parameters not well-defined

For institutional capital deployment, we need more comprehensive validation points and clearer risk parameters. The current setup doesn't
