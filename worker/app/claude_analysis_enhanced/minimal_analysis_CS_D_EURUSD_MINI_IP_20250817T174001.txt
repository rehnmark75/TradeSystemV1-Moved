Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical market context and technical confirmation data is lacking for a high-confidence institutional position, particularly during the NY session where volatility can spike unexpectedly. While the system confidence is high at 85%, the absence of market regime analysis, support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators provides insufficient edge for professional capital deployment at the specified 1.12340 level.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll assess this signal with a strong focus on execution quality and risk management:

SCORE: 4
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Critical market context and technical confirmation data is lacking for a high-confidence institutional position, particularly during the NY session where volatility can spike unexpectedly. While the system confidence is high at 85%, the absence of market regime analysis, support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators provides insufficient edge for professional capital deployment at the specified 1.12340 level.

Note: For institutional-grade decisions, I would require, at minimum:
- Key S/R levels
- Momentum readings
- Market structure context
- Volatility metrics
- Recent price action patterns
- Correlated pair movements

The current data set lacks these essential components for proper risk assessment.
