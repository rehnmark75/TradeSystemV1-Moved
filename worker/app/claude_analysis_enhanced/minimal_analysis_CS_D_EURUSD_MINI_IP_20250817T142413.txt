Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the timing during London/NY overlap provides optimal liquidity conditions, the signal lacks critical context regarding market regime, momentum conditions, and key technical levels that would justify institutional capital deployment. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without clear understanding of prevailing market structure and correlation analysis with major risk factors, the risk/reward profile remains inadequately defined for professional position sizing.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on what matters most for professional execution.

Note: The provided information is insufficient for full institutional-grade analysis. Critical missing elements include: multi-timeframe structure, key support/resistance levels, relevant correlations, and broader market regime context - all essential for professional trade execution.
