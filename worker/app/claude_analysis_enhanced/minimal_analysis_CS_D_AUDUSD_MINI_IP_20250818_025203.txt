Signal: BEAR
Price: 0.65132
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite high system confidence (90%), this setup presents problematic timing during low-volatility Tokyo session with conflicting technical signals - short-term bullish EMAs against proposed bearish direction. While volume is notably high (68.0), the tight EMA separations (1.4 & 0.1 pips) and mid-range positioning (51.2%) suggest insufficient directional conviction for institutional capital deployment. Risk/reward appears suboptimal given the narrow 19.1 pip range and counter-trend nature against prevailing short-term momentum.
