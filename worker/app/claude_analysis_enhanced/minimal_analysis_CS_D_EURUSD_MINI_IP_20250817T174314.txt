Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal lacks critical technical confluence data (momentum indicators, key price levels, order flow analysis) and market regime context that would be essential for institutional position-taking at this level. While the system confidence is high at 85% and liquidity conditions are favorable during NY session, there's insufficient evidence of institutional order flow or technical structure to justify risk deployment, especially given the round-number proximity to 1.1235.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal lacks critical technical confluence data (momentum indicators, key price levels, order flow analysis) and market regime context that would be essential for institutional position-taking at this level. While the system confidence is high at 85% and liquidity conditions are favorable during NY session, there's insufficient evidence of institutional order flow or technical structure to justify risk deployment, especially given the round-number proximity to 1.1235.

Note: Without visibility into market regime indicators, key supply/demand zones, and order flow metrics, initiating positions would fall below institutional risk management standards.
