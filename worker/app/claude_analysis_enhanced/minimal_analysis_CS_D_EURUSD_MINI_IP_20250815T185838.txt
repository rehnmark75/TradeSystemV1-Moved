Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the signal shows high system confidence (85%) and favorable liquidity conditions during NY session, there's insufficient technical context provided for proper institutional-grade position sizing and risk assessment. The lack of market regime analysis, key support/resistance levels, and broader momentum indicators makes this signal incomplete for professional execution standards. Current market positioning would require additional confirmation through intermarket correlations and order flow analysis before commitment of institutional capital.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this from an institutional perspective:

SCORE: 6/10

The lack of market regime analysis, key support/resistance levels, and broader momentum indicators makes this signal incomplete for professional execution standards. Current market positioning would require additional confirmation through intermarket correlations and order flow analysis before commitment of institutional capital.

Note: For institutional-grade trade decisions, I would typically require complete order flow analysis, key technical levels, and broader market regime context. The current signal lacks critical data points needed for high-confidence institutional positioning.
