Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical market context and technical confluence data is missing to validate the 85% system confidence - particularly concerning during the volatile London/NY overlap period. Entry at 1.12340 lacks clear support/resistance context and associated risk parameters (stops/targets) are undefined, making proper position sizing impossible despite the "standard" recommendation. Professional execution requires substantially more technical validation, especially for a major pair during peak liquidity.

Raw Response:
As a senior institutional forex analyst, I must flag several concerns with this signal:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Critical market context and technical confluence data is missing to validate the 85% system confidence - particularly concerning during the volatile London/NY overlap period. Entry at 1.12340 lacks clear support/resistance context and associated risk parameters (stops/targets) are undefined, making proper position sizing impossible despite the "standard" recommendation. Professional execution requires substantially more technical validation, especially for a major pair during peak liquidity.

The high system confidence contrasted with minimal technical justification raises red flags that would make this unsuitable for institutional capital deployment under strict risk management requirements.
