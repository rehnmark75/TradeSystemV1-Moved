Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal timing during Tokyo session presents suboptimal execution conditions with wider spreads and insufficient liquidity for meaningful institutional positioning. Critical technical context and market regime data are missing, making proper risk assessment impossible. Additionally, the 85% system confidence appears disconnected from current market dynamics and volume profile characteristics typical of this trading session.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on what matters most for professional execution.

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal timing during Tokyo session presents suboptimal execution conditions with wider spreads and insufficient liquidity for meaningful institutional positioning. Critical technical context and market regime data are missing, making proper risk assessment impossible. Additionally, the 85% system confidence appears disconnected from current market dynamics and volume profile characteristics typical of this trading session.

I base this primarily on liquidity profile concerns and incomplete technical structure validation that would be required for institutional-grade execution standards. The lack of market regime context is particularly concerning for position sizing and risk management at an institutional level.
