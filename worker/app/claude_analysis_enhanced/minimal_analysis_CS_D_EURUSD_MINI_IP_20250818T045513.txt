Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal presents insufficient technical context during the lower-volatility Tokyo session, lacking critical confluence factors and clear risk parameters. Entry at 1.12340 appears arbitrary without supporting market structure validation or key technical levels, while the approaching London/NY session overlap presents heightened reversal risk. The 85% system confidence is not substantiated by observable technical criteria that would justify institutional capital deployment.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal presents insufficient technical context during the lower-volatility Tokyo session, lacking critical confluence factors and clear risk parameters. Entry at 1.12340 appears arbitrary without supporting market structure validation or key technical levels, while the approaching London/NY session overlap presents heightened reversal risk. The 85% system confidence is not substantiated by observable technical criteria that would justify institutional capital deployment.

The rejection stems primarily from incomplete risk assessment and absence of price action context required for high-probability institutional positioning. A professional trade setup would require clearly defined support/resistance levels, volume profile validation, and multiple timeframe confluence - none of which are provided in this signal.
