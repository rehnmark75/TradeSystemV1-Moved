Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap typically offers optimal liquidity conditions, the provided signal lacks critical technical confluence points and key market regime context necessary for institutional position sizing. The 85% system confidence appears optimistic without supporting market structure validation, and entering during the volatile overlap period without clear technical boundaries presents unfavorable risk/reward characteristics for large position management.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on execution quality and risk parameters.

Additional Institutional Consideration: In a professional trading environment, I would require multiple timeframe validation and specific volatility metrics before committing institutional capital during a major session overlap, especially with EUR/USD's current positioning.
