Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the 85% system confidence and optimal London/NY overlap timing are favorable, the signal lacks critical market regime context and technical confluence points to validate the entry. The high liquidity environment during this session typically demands multiple confirmation factors for institutional position-taking, which are notably absent from this setup. Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without key resistance/support levels and market structure context.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll assess this signal with institutional precision:

Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without key resistance/support levels and market structure context.

I've rated this 6/10 acknowledging the positive timing and liquidity factors, but rejected execution due to insufficient technical validation that would be required for institutional capital deployment. This type of setup would benefit from additional market structure analysis and clear invalidation levels before considering position entry.
