Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the high system confidence (85%), this signal lacks critical technical context and confluence factors needed for institutional-grade execution. The absence of market regime data, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators severely limits our ability to validate the directional bias. The NY session timing is favorable for liquidity, but without clear technical structure or risk parameters, this setup fails to meet professional risk/reward standards.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Despite the high system confidence (85%), this signal lacks critical technical context and confluence factors needed for institutional-grade execution. The absence of market regime data, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators severely limits our ability to validate the directional bias. The NY session timing is favorable for liquidity, but without clear technical structure or risk parameters, this setup fails to meet professional risk/reward standards.

While I aim to maintain an aggressive profit-seeking approach, the missing technical context makes proper risk assessment impossible at an institutional level. I'd require, at minimum, clear price structure, momentum confirmation, and defined invalidation levels before considering capital deployment at these levels.
