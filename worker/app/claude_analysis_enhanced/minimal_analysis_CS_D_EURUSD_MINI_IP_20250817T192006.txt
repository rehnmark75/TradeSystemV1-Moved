Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the signal demonstrates high system confidence (85%) and favorable liquidity conditions during NY session, the lack of crucial market regime context and supporting technical confirmation creates an unfavorable blind spot in risk assessment. Professional execution requires comprehensive market context validation, particularly for major pairs like EUR/USD where institutional flow dynamics significantly impact price action. Without clear market structure context and confirmation of key technical levels, the risk/reward profile doesn't meet institutional standards.

Raw Response:
