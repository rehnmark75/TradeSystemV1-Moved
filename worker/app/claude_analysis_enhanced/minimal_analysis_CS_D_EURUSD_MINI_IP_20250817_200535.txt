Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BULL
Price: 1.171635
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: The setup shows strong technical alignment with price above all EMAs in perfect bullish structure, supported by high-conviction volume (20.0x ratio). While MACD momentum is relatively weak, the favorable risk/reward with clear support at 1.16946 and prime liquidity during NY session provides attractive trade mechanics. The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00068) suggests controlled risk parameters, though position sizing should remain conservative given the mid-range price location.
