Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal lacks critical technical context and momentum validation during the lower-liquidity Tokyo session, presenting suboptimal execution conditions. The 85% system confidence appears disconnected from the limited market context provided, and entry during pre-London hours typically offers poor risk/reward dynamics. Without clear market regime data or technical confluence points, institutional capital deployment would be unjustified at this level.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:
