Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the high system confidence and favorable session timing during London/NY overlap, the signal lacks critical technical context and market regime analysis required for institutional position-taking. The absence of key support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and broader market structure makes proper risk/reward assessment impossible. While liquidity conditions are optimal, insufficient technical validation creates unacceptable execution risk for institutional capital deployment.

Raw Response:
