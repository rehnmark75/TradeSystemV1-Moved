Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite high system confidence (92%) and strong volume (72.0), the current mid-range position (43.3%) combined with weak MACD momentum (0.000016) suggests insufficient directional conviction. The risk/reward ratio is suboptimal given the 23.5 pip range and price location, while the bearish short-term trend structure (EMA 9<21) contradicts the proposed bullish direction. Tokyo session's lower liquidity environment further reduces the probability of a clean breakout.
