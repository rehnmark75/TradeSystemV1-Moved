Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmatory data points needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without market regime analysis, key support/resistance levels, or momentum indicators, there's insufficient edge to justify capital deployment at 1.12340 under strict institutional risk parameters.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmatory data points needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without market regime analysis, key support/resistance levels, or momentum indicators, there's insufficient edge to justify capital deployment at 1.12340 under strict institutional risk parameters.

Note: To improve execution quality for institutional trading requirements, this signal would need correlation analysis across related pairs, volume profile context, and recent volatility metrics to validate the proposed entry point against expected intraday ranges.
