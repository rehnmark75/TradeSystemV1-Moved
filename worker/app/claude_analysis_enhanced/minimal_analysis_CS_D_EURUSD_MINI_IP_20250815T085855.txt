Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is optimal for EUR/USD execution, the signal lacks critical technical context and price action validation metrics required for institutional position-taking.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the most critical decision factors:
