Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal presents insufficient technical context during relatively illiquid Tokyo session, with potential volatility increase approaching London/NY crossover that could create unfavorable entry conditions. The 85% system confidence lacks supporting validation from key technical indicators, market structure analysis, or significant institutional price levels. Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without critical market regime context and clear technical validation points.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective, focusing on key decision factors:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal presents insufficient technical context during relatively illiquid Tokyo session, with potential volatility increase approaching London/NY crossover that could create unfavorable entry conditions. The 85% system confidence lacks supporting validation from key technical indicators, market structure analysis, or significant institutional price levels. Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without critical market regime context and clear technical validation points.

Note: As an institutional desk trader, I would need substantially more technical context, including:
- Key institutional price levels
- Market structure analysis
- Volume profile
- Order flow indicators
- Intermarket correlations
before considering position deployment with client capital, especially during transitional market sessions.
