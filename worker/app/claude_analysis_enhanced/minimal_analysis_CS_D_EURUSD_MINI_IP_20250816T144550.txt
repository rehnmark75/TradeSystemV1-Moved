Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for EUR/USD liquidity, the signal lacks critical technical context including key support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and order flow analysis needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corroborating market structure evidence and clear invalidation levels for risk management.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective:
