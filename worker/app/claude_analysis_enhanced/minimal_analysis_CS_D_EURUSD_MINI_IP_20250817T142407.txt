Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 3/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical market data is missing for institutional-grade analysis, including momentum indicators, key support/resistance levels, and broader market regime context. While the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, executing a long position without clear technical validation or defined risk parameters violates fundamental institutional risk management protocols. The 85% system confidence appears arbitrary without supporting quantitative evidence.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I need to highlight significant concerns with this signal:

SCORE: 3/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Critical market data is missing for institutional-grade analysis, including momentum indicators, key support/resistance levels, and broader market regime context. While the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, executing a long position without clear technical validation or defined risk parameters violates fundamental institutional risk management protocols. The 85% system confidence appears arbitrary without supporting quantitative evidence.

I would require, at minimum:
- Key S/R levels for risk placement
- Volume/momentum validation
- Clear market structure analysis
- Correlation with related pairs
- Broader macro context

The current data set is insufficient for deploying institutional capital, regardless of the positive liquidity conditions during the session overlap.
