Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the 85% system confidence and favorable NY session liquidity are positive factors, the signal lacks critical technical confluence and market regime context required for institutional position-taking. The absence of clear risk parameters and identifiable market structure makes this a suboptimal setup from a risk/reward perspective, particularly for a major pair where we require multiple confirmation factors for high-probability entries.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the 85% system confidence and favorable NY session liquidity are positive factors, the signal lacks critical technical confluence and market regime context required for institutional position-taking. The absence of clear risk parameters and identifiable market structure makes this a suboptimal setup from a risk/reward perspective, particularly for a major pair where we require multiple confirmation factors for high-probability entries.

I recommend waiting for a setup with more comprehensive technical validation and clearly defined market context to ensure proper risk/reward alignment with institutional standards.
