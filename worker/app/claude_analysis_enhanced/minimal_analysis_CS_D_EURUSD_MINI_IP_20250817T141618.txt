Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is optimal for EUR/USD execution, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmation factors required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without clear market regime analysis, key support/resistance levels, or momentum indicators, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly quantified to institutional standards. Additionally, entering major positions ahead of potential London/NY session volatility without clear technical validation increases execution risk unnecessarily.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective:
