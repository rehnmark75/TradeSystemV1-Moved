Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the system confidence is high at 85% and the timing during NY session offers good liquidity conditions, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate a high-conviction entry at 1.12340. Critical elements missing include momentum indicators, key level analysis, and broader market regime context - these are essential for institutional position-taking. The risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without clear technical boundaries and market structure context.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:
