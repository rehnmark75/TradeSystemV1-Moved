Signal: BULL
Price: 1.380295
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the high volume (46.0x ratio) suggests strong conviction, the weak MACD momentum (0.000013) combined with conflicting trend signals (bearish short-term EMAs vs bullish MACD crossover) indicates potential choppy price action ahead. The position's location in mid-range (37.9%) during low volatility Tokyo session with tight EMA separation (0.01%) suggests insufficient directional bias for institutional position sizing, making risk/reward suboptimal for current market conditions.
