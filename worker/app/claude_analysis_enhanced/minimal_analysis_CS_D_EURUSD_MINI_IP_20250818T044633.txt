Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal lacks critical technical context and market structure confirmation during the typically thin Tokyo session, making the 85% system confidence questionable. Entry at 1.12340 during lower liquidity conditions increases execution risk, while the absence of market regime analysis severely limits our ability to validate the directional bias. Professional risk management dictates avoiding trades with incomplete technical framework despite major pair status.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal lacks critical technical context and market structure confirmation during the typically thin Tokyo session, making the 85% system confidence questionable. Entry at 1.12340 during lower liquidity conditions increases execution risk, while the absence of market regime analysis severely limits our ability to validate the directional bias. Professional risk management dictates avoiding trades with incomplete technical framework despite major pair status.

Additional Professional Note: While the upcoming London/NY overlap could provide better liquidity conditions, initiating positions during Asian hours without clear institutional-grade technical validation and volume confirmation would not meet institutional risk standards.
