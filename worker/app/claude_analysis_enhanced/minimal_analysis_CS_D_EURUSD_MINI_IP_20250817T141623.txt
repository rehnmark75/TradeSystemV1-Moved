Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the 85% system confidence and optimal session timing (London/NY overlap) are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and regime analysis needed for institutional position-taking. Without clear market structure confirmation, defined support/resistance levels, or correlation analysis against related pairs, the risk/reward cannot be properly quantified to institutional standards. The high liquidity environment could also introduce significant noise during the overlap period.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:
