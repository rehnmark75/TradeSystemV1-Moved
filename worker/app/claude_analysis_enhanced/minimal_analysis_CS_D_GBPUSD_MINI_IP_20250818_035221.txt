Signal: BULL
Price: 1.3556249999999999
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Despite the overall bearish trend structure, this setup presents a compelling risk/reward ratio with price action showing strength near key support (1.35478) and high volume confirmation (72.0x ratio) suggesting strong buyer conviction. The bullish MACD crossover combined with price positioning above all EMAs provides technical validation, while the relatively tight 8.5-pip distance to support enables precise risk management - though position sizing should be moderate given the Tokyo session's lower liquidity conditions.
