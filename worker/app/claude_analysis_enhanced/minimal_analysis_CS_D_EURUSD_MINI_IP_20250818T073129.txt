Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmation indicators required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence appears disconnected from market regime analysis, and without clear support/resistance levels or momentum confirmation, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly assessed for position sizing optimization.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmation indicators required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence appears disconnected from market regime analysis, and without clear support/resistance levels or momentum confirmation, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly assessed for position sizing optimization.

Additional Institutional Note: Would require minimum volume profile analysis, key technical level context, and order flow verification before considering execution at proposed entry level during high-impact session overlap.
