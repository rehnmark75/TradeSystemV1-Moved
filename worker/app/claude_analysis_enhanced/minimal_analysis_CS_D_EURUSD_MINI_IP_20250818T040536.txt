Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal presents significant execution concerns during Tokyo session where lower liquidity could lead to wider spreads and potential slippage, particularly problematic for precision entry at 1.12340. Additionally, the lack of market regime context and specific technical confluence points makes risk/reward optimization challenging. While system confidence is high at 85%, institutional capital deployment requires more robust technical validation, especially during off-peak trading hours.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this through an institutional lens, focusing on execution quality and risk-adjusted returns:
