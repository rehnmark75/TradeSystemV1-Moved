Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 3/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the high system confidence and favorable session timing at London/NY overlap, there is insufficient technical evidence to validate the proposed long position. Critical elements missing include trend structure, key price levels, momentum indicators, and orderflow context that are essential for institutional position-taking. The lack of market regime analysis and clear risk parameters makes this unsuitable for professional capital deployment.

Raw Response:
As a senior institutional forex analyst, I have serious concerns about executing this signal given the limited technical context provided:

Professional Note: While the liquidity conditions appear favorable, I cannot responsibly approve trade execution without comprehensive technical validation and clearly defined risk parameters that meet institutional standards. The quality of execution requires more robust confirmation signals.
