Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the system confidence is high at 85% and the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate the long position at 1.12340. Critical components missing include market structure analysis, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators that would be essential for institutional position-taking. The lack of clear risk parameters and market regime context makes this setup suboptimal from a risk/reward perspective.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT

The lack of clear risk parameters and market regime context makes this setup suboptimal from a risk/reward perspective.

Additional Professional Note: Would need to see volume profile, order flow metrics, and institutional positioning data to consider an approval, particularly for a major pair during peak liquidity hours.
