Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical signal data elements are missing for institutional-grade validation, including key support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and multi-timeframe confirmation. The 85% system confidence lacks contextual market regime data to verify reliability, and the "TEST" detection strategy raises concerns about the signal's production readiness. While the NY session timing is favorable for liquidity, insufficient technical validation makes this unsuitable for institutional capital deployment.
