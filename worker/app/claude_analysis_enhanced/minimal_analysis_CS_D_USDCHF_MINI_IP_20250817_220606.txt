Epic: CS.D.USDCHF.MINI.IP
Signal: BULL
Price: 0.8064800000000001
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: APPROVE (WITH TIGHT RISK MANAGEMENT)
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the small bullish bias indicated by EMA alignments and MACD crossover, the position within range (71.6% from support) suggests limited upside potential compared to downside risk. However, the high volume ratio (162.0) and clear technical structure provide sufficient conviction for a controlled position entry, though proximity to resistance at 0.80714 necessitates precise exit management and smaller position sizing than standard.

Note to institutional desk: Consider scaling entry to manage exposure given transition period liquidity conditions. Hard stop below nearest support at 0.80482 recommended.
