Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the system confidence is high at 85% and the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate the long position at 1.12340. Critical elements missing include current market structure, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators that would be essential for institutional position-taking. The lack of market regime analysis further increases uncertainty around trade context.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal with an institutional perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the system confidence is high at 85% and the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate the long position at 1.12340. Critical elements missing include current market structure, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators that would be essential for institutional position-taking. The lack of market regime analysis further increases uncertainty around trade context.

Note: An institutional-grade recommendation would require comprehensive order flow analysis, key technical level mapping, and correlation checks with related pairs to ensure optimal risk-adjusted returns. Current signal data is too limited for high-conviction deployment of institutional capital.
