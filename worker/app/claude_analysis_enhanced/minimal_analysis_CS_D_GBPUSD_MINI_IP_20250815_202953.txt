Epic: CS.D.GBPUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BULL
Price: 1.355615
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Signal shows favorable technical alignment with price positioned above all EMAs while testing support, backed by unusually high volume (246x ratio) indicating strong institutional interest. Risk/reward is attractive with nearby support at 1.35478 allowing tight stop placement, while the 30.7 pip distance to resistance provides adequate profit potential for a 1:3.6 ratio. The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00070) suggests reduced slippage risk, though position sizing should be moderated due to ranging conditions.
