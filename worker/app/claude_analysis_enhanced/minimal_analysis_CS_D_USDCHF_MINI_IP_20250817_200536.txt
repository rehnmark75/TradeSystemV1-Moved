Epic: CS.D.USDCHF.MINI.IP
Signal: BEAR
Price: 0.8051900000000001
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite high system confidence and strong volume, the conflicting trend signals (short-term bullish EMAs vs bearish price position) create an unclear directional bias. The tight EMA separations (0.5-1.1 pips) indicate choppy, range-bound conditions, while the mid-range price position (38.3%) offers suboptimal risk/reward for institutional position sizing. The weak MACD histogram (-0.000054) suggests insufficient momentum to justify aggressive positioning in current market conditions.
