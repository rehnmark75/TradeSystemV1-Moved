Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context including momentum indicators, key level analysis, and clear invalidation points that are essential for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corroborating market structure analysis and defined risk parameters. Additionally, the lack of market regime context makes it impossible to properly evaluate the trade's alignment with broader institutional flows.
