Epic: CS.D.USDCAD.MINI.IP
Signal: BEAR
Price: 1.379855
Strategy: MACD
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the high volume (178x ratio) suggests strong conviction, the confluence of weak MACD momentum (-0.000007) and price sitting in mid-range (26.8%) presents suboptimal entry conditions. The small separation between EMAs (1.0-1.7 pips) indicates choppy, range-bound conditions which, combined with low ATR (0.00034), suggests poor risk/reward potential for institutional position sizing.
