Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BULL
Price: 1.16994
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 8/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Strong technical setup with price positioned above all EMAs in perfect alignment, supported by high volume (148x ratio) indicating institutional participation. The proximity to established support (4.8 pips) provides favorable risk/reward given the 16.2 pip distance to resistance, while the London/NY session overlap offers optimal liquidity conditions for execution. The bullish momentum is further validated by the MACD crossover, though the relatively low ATR suggests controlled position sizing is prudent.
