Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal lacks critical technical confirmation data and is proposed during suboptimal Tokyo session liquidity conditions, presenting execution risk. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market regime context and key technical levels for proper risk/reward assessment. Additionally, trading major pairs during Asian sessions typically offers poor risk-adjusted returns due to wider spreads and increased price rejection probability.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal lacks critical technical confirmation data and is proposed during suboptimal Tokyo session liquidity conditions, presenting execution risk. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market regime context and key technical levels for proper risk/reward assessment. Additionally, trading major pairs during Asian sessions typically offers poor risk-adjusted returns due to wider spreads and increased price rejection probability.

While maintaining concision as requested, I should note that professional institutional trading during Asian sessions for EUR/USD typically requires significantly more technical validation, particularly around the 1.1234 level which has historical significance. The lack of comprehensive technical analysis makes this a high-risk proposition from a risk management perspective.
