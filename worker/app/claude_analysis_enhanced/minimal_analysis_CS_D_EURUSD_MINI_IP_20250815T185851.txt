Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the signal presents during optimal liquidity conditions during NY session, the provided analysis lacks critical technical confluence points and clear risk parameters. The 85% system confidence appears optimistic without supporting market structure validation or key technical levels for risk definition. From an institutional risk management perspective, insufficient context regarding broader market regime and potential catalysts makes this a suboptimal institutional-grade setup.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the signal presents during optimal liquidity conditions during NY session, the provided analysis lacks critical technical confluence points and clear risk parameters. The 85% system confidence appears optimistic without supporting market structure validation or key technical levels for risk definition. From an institutional risk management perspective, insufficient context regarding broader market regime and potential catalysts makes this a suboptimal institutional-grade setup.

Note: As a senior analyst, I would need substantially more technical context including: key S/R levels, market structure analysis, relevant timeframe data, and specific risk parameters to properly evaluate this as an institutional-grade opportunity. The current signal data is too limited for high-conviction capital deployment.
