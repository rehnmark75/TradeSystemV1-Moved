Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity environment are favorable conditions, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmed support/resistance levels to validate the proposed entry. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corresponding market regime analysis and clear catalysts. From an institutional risk management perspective, there's inadequate data to justify capital deployment at this entry point.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity environment are favorable conditions, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmed support/resistance levels to validate the proposed entry. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corresponding market regime analysis and clear catalysts. From an institutional risk management perspective, there's inadequate data to justify capital deployment at this entry point.

Key institutional concerns that factored into this decision:
- Missing market regime analysis prevents proper volatility alignment
- No confirmation of key technical levels or momentum indicators
- Insufficient context around positioning and order flow dynamics
- Entry lacks defined invalidation points for risk management

This is the type of signal that requires additional technical validation before considering institutional capital deployment.
