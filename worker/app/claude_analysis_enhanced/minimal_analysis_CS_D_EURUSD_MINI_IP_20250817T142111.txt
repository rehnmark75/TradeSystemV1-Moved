Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is optimal for EUR/USD execution, the signal lacks critical technical confluence and market regime context needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without clear insight into prevailing market structure, momentum indicators, or key technical levels, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly quantified for meaningful capital deployment.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key technical and contextual elements:

Additional institutional consideration: The timestamp shows this is for 2025, making it a forward-dated hypothetical scenario which would require additional validation parameters for actual execution.
