Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the 85% system confidence and high liquidity environment during London/NY overlap are favorable, the signal lacks critical market regime context and technical confluence points to justify institutional capital deployment. The absence of clear risk parameters and market structure analysis makes this setup suboptimal from a risk-adjusted return perspective, especially for significant position sizing during potentially volatile cross-session trading.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on execution quality and risk parameters:
