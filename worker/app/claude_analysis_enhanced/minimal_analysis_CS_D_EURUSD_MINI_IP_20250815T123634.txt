Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the high system confidence and favorable liquidity conditions during London/NY overlap, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate the long position at 1.12340. Critical components missing include current market structure, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators that would be essential for institutional position-taking. The risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without clear technical boundaries and market regime context.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT

Critical components missing include current market structure, key support/resistance levels, and momentum indicators that would be essential for institutional position-taking. The risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without clear technical boundaries and market regime context.

As a senior institutional analyst, I would require substantially more technical data and market context to approve capital deployment, especially on a major pair like EUR/USD where precise entry timing and technical validation are crucial for optimal execution.
