Signal: BULL
Price: 1.381365
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Strong technical setup with price above all EMAs showing clear bullish structure, supported by high-volume confirmation (430x ratio) indicating genuine institutional flow. While MACD shows relatively weak momentum, the London session timing and proper market structure provide favorable conditions for institutional positioning, though tight risk management is advised given the relatively low ATR (0.00074).

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 7/10
DECISION: APPROVE
REASON: Strong technical setup with price above all EMAs showing clear bullish structure, supported by high-volume confirmation (430x ratio) indicating genuine institutional flow. While MACD shows relatively weak momentum, the London session timing and proper market structure provide favorable conditions for institutional positioning, though tight risk management is advised given the relatively low ATR (0.00074).

The key institutional considerations here are the volume signature, clean technical structure, and session timing - all aligning with professional trading parameters. However, this position should be managed with disciplined size given the compressed volatility environment.
