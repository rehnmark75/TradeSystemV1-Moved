Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and market regime analysis needed for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without clear support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, or broader market correlation data, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly assessed to institutional standards.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

The 85% system confidence is notable, but without clear support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, or broader market correlation data, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly assessed to institutional standards.

As an institutional trader, I would require significantly more technical and contextual data before committing capital, particularly:
- Current market regime (trending/ranging)
- Key technical levels and order flow analysis
- Correlation with other major pairs
- Relevant economic calendar events
- Intraday volatility metrics

The signal appears too isolated from broader market context for institutional execution standards.
