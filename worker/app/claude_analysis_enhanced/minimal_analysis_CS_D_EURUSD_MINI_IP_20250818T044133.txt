Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal lacks critical technical context and presents during suboptimal Tokyo session liquidity conditions when spreads are typically wider. The 85% system confidence is undermined by insufficient market regime data and absence of key technical levels/confluence points. Without clear risk parameters and validated support/resistance levels, this setup fails to meet institutional risk management standards.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal lacks critical technical context and presents during suboptimal Tokyo session liquidity conditions when spreads are typically wider. The 85% system confidence is undermined by insufficient market regime data and absence of key technical levels/confluence points. Without clear risk parameters and validated support/resistance levels, this setup fails to meet institutional risk management standards.

Note: While not included in the format, I feel compelled to add that professional traders would require significant additional data points for proper validation, including:
- Key technical levels and market structure
- Volatility metrics
- Recent price action patterns
- Clear invalidation levels
- Correlation with related pairs
- Relevant economic calendar events

The current signal structure lacks these essential components for institutional-grade decision making.
