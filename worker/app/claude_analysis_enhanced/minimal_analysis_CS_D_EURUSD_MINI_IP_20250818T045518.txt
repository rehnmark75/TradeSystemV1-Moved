Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal lacks critical technical context and confluence factors needed for institutional-grade execution during Asian session. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market structure analysis, key level identification, or clear catalyst expectations for the London/NY crossover. Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without defined support/resistance levels or broader trend context.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I must approach this signal with appropriate scrutiny, particularly given the timing during the typically lower-liquidity Tokyo session.

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal lacks critical technical context and confluence factors needed for institutional-grade execution during Asian session. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market structure analysis, key level identification, or clear catalyst expectations for the London/NY crossover. Risk/reward cannot be properly assessed without defined support/resistance levels or broader trend context.

The notable absence of market regime data and technical indicators makes this a suboptimal setup from an institutional risk management perspective, particularly for a major pair like EUR/USD where we require multiple confirmation factors before deploying capital.
