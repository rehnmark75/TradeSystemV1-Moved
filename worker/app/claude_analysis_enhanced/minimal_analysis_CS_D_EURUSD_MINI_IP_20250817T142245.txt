Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing offers favorable liquidity conditions, the signal lacks critical technical context including momentum indicators, key support/resistance levels, and broader market structure analysis. The 85% system confidence appears arbitrary without underlying validation metrics, and the absence of market regime analysis significantly impairs our ability to gauge directional probability. Professional risk management requires more comprehensive technical validation before capital deployment.
