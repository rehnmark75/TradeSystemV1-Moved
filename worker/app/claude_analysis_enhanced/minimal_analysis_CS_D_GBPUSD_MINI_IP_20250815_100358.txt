Signal: BULL
Price: 1.3559649999999999
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite strong bullish EMA alignment and high volume conviction (321x ratio), the entry price is positioned precariously close to immediate resistance (1.2 pips away) at 97.1% of the current range, presenting an unfavorable risk/reward setup. The weak MACD momentum (0.000001) combined with the range-bound market regime suggests limited upside potential, while the proximity to resistance creates asymmetric downside risk in this low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00051).
