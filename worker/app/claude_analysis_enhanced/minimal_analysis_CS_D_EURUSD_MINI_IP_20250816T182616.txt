Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the high liquidity environment during NY session is favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmatory price action evidence for institutional-grade execution. Without clear market regime analysis and specific momentum indicators, there's insufficient validation of the 85% system confidence, particularly at the 1.12340 level where institutional positioning data would be crucial for trade conviction.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the high liquidity environment during NY session is favorable, the signal lacks critical technical context and confirmatory price action evidence for institutional-grade execution. Without clear market regime analysis and specific momentum indicators, there's insufficient validation of the 85% system confidence, particularly at the 1.12340 level where institutional positioning data would be crucial for trade conviction.

I would need additional context on:
- Current market structure vs key institutional order flow levels
- Aggregate positioning metrics 
- Relevant intraday volume profile
- Correlated asset flows (esp. rates markets)
to consider this actionable from an institutional risk management perspective.
