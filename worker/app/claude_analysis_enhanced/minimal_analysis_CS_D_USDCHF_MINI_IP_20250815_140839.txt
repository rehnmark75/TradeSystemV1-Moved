Signal: BEAR
Price: 0.8051250000000001
Strategy: COMBINED
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Strong technical setup with perfect EMA alignment and clear bearish structure, supported by high volume (659x ratio) indicating institutional participation. While MACD shows relatively weak momentum, the London session timing and price positioning below all EMAs provides favorable conditions for continuation. Risk appears contained with low volatility (ATR: 0.00055), suggesting potential for precise entry execution with tight risk management parameters.
