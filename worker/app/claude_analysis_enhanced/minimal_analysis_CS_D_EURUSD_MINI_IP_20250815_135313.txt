Signal: BULL
Price: 1.17047
Strategy: COMBINED
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 8/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Strong technical setup with perfect EMA alignment and high volume (765.0) indicating substantial institutional interest during the critical London/NY overlap. While MACD shows relatively weak momentum (0.000038), the bullish crossover combined with price positioning above all EMAs presents a high-probability institutional entry point. The low volatility environment (ATR: 0.00074) suggests reduced whipsaw risk, though position sizing should remain standard given the range-bound market regime.
