Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal presents insufficient technical context during relatively illiquid Tokyo session, with entry positioning ahead of major session overlap that typically introduces heightened volatility and potential gap risk. While system confidence is high at 85%, the lack of market regime data and clear technical validation points creates an unfavorable risk/reward profile for institutional capital deployment, particularly given the timing relative to upcoming London/NY crossover.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal presents insufficient technical context during relatively illiquid Tokyo session, with entry positioning ahead of major session overlap that typically introduces heightened volatility and potential gap risk. While system confidence is high at 85%, the lack of market regime data and clear technical validation points creates an unfavorable risk/reward profile for institutional capital deployment, particularly given the timing relative to upcoming London/NY crossover.

Key concerns:
- Entry timing during lower liquidity phase
- Missing critical technical validation metrics
- Risk of session transition volatility
- Insufficient context for position sizing optimization

The proposed setup would not meet institutional risk management requirements without additional technical confirmation and more favorable timing alignment.
