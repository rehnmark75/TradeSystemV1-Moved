Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the system confidence is high at 85% and the London/NY overlap timing is favorable for liquidity, there's insufficient technical context provided to validate the long position at 1.12340. Critical components missing include momentum indicators, key support/resistance levels, and broader market regime analysis which are essential for institutional position-taking. The lack of defined risk parameters in a major pair during peak volatility presents unnecessary exposure.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 6/10

The lack of defined risk parameters in a major pair during peak volatility presents unnecessary exposure.

[Professional Note: For institutional trading decisions, I would require, at minimum: clear price structure analysis, specific S/R levels, momentum confirmation across multiple timeframes, and correlation analysis with related pairs. The current signal lacks these crucial institutional-grade validation points.]
