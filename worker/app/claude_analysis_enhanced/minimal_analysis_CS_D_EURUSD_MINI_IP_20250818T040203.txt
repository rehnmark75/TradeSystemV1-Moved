Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal presents insufficient technical validation during the lower-liquidity Tokyo session, raising execution quality concerns. The 85% system confidence is undermined by the lack of crucial market regime context and defined technical confluence points. Entry at 1.12340 during pre-London hours creates unfavorable risk/reward dynamics due to potential liquidity gaps and wider spreads.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal presents insufficient technical validation during the lower-liquidity Tokyo session, raising execution quality concerns. The 85% system confidence is undermined by the lack of crucial market regime context and defined technical confluence points. Entry at 1.12340 during pre-London hours creates unfavorable risk/reward dynamics due to potential liquidity gaps and wider spreads.

I've assigned a low score primarily due to the timing and incomplete technical framework. Any institutional position taken during this session would face suboptimal execution conditions and potential slippage risks that could materially impact the trade's probability of success.
