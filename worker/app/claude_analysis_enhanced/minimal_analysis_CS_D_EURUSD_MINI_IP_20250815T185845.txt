Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the NY session timing and high liquidity conditions are favorable, the signal lacks crucial technical context and key market regime indicators required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable, but without supporting price action analysis, momentum indicators, or clear risk parameters, this setup falls short of institutional execution standards. Additionally, trading major pairs during the volatile NY session requires more comprehensive technical validation than provided.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the critical elements:
