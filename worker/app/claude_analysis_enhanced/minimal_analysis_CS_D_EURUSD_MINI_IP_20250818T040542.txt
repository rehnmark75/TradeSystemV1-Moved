Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal lacks critical technical context and presents during the relatively illiquid Tokyo session, creating potential execution risks. The 85% system confidence appears optimistic given the limited supporting data, and initiating a long position without clear market regime analysis or momentum confirmation violates institutional risk protocols. While EUR/USD is highly liquid, the timing ahead of London/NY overlap suggests waiting for better price discovery and volume confirmation.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal lacks critical technical context and presents during the relatively illiquid Tokyo session, creating potential execution risks. The 85% system confidence appears optimistic given the limited supporting data, and initiating a long position without clear market regime analysis or momentum confirmation violates institutional risk protocols. While EUR/USD is highly liquid, the timing ahead of London/NY overlap suggests waiting for better price discovery and volume confirmation.

The above professional assessment prioritizes execution quality and risk management based on the incomplete technical picture and suboptimal timing. Key institutional considerations like liquidity risk, technical confirmation, and precise entry validation are not sufficiently addressed in the signal data.
