Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 3/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical signal data is missing including trend structure, key support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and broader market regime context which are essential for institutional position-taking. While the NY session timing and EUR/USD liquidity profile are favorable, the 85% system confidence lacks validation metrics and the standalone price level of 1.12340 provides insufficient technical context for a high-conviction trade setup. Professional risk management requires more comprehensive analysis before capital deployment.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I must highlight significant concerns with this signal:

I would need substantially more technical context and market structure data to consider approving this signal for institutional trading purposes.
