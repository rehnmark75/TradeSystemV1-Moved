Signal: BULL
Price: 1.380895
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Despite the bullish EMA alignment and high volume indicating institutional interest, the weak MACD momentum (0.000011) coupled with unclear resistance levels presents suboptimal risk/reward for institutional capital deployment. The low ATR (0.00074) suggests potential ranging conditions, and with price positioned mid-range without clear resistance definition, this setup lacks the precision required for institutional position taking during the volatile London session.
