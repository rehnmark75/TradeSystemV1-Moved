Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: The signal lacks critical technical context and appears during the lower-liquidity Tokyo session, presenting suboptimal execution conditions for institutional positioning. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market regime data, key technical levels, or volatility metrics to validate the long bias. Entry timing ahead of the London/NY overlap suggests heightened slippage risk without compensating reward potential.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: The signal lacks critical technical context and appears during the lower-liquidity Tokyo session, presenting suboptimal execution conditions for institutional positioning. The 85% system confidence is insufficient without supporting market regime data, key technical levels, or volatility metrics to validate the long bias. Entry timing ahead of the London/NY overlap suggests heightened slippage risk without compensating reward potential.

The high degree of missing technical information (no momentum readings, key support/resistance levels, or market regime analysis) makes this an institutionally non-viable signal despite targeting a major pair. Professional capital deployment requires more comprehensive validation metrics, particularly during off-peak trading sessions.
