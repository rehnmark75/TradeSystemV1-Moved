Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the proposed entry occurs during optimal liquidity conditions at the NY/London overlap, the signal lacks critical technical context including momentum indicators, key price levels, and order flow analysis required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corresponding market structure validation and clear invalidation levels. Additionally, forward-looking risk assessment is limited without visibility into current market regime and broader technical framework.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:

SCORE: 6/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: While the proposed entry occurs during optimal liquidity conditions at the NY/London overlap, the signal lacks critical technical context including momentum indicators, key price levels, and order flow analysis required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corresponding market structure validation and clear invalidation levels. Additionally, forward-looking risk assessment is limited without visibility into current market regime and broader technical framework.

I base this conservative rejection primarily on insufficient technical context that would be required for deploying institutional capital, despite the favorable timing and liquidity conditions. From a risk management perspective, we need more comprehensive validation points before committing capital at this level.
