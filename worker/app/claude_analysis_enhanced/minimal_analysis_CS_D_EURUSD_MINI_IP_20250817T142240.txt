Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the signal confidence is high at 85% and the London/NY overlap provides optimal liquidity conditions, the lack of critical market regime context and technical confluence points creates an unfavorable blind spot in risk assessment. The timing during high-volatility London session requires additional confirmation layers that are currently absent, and without clear market structure context, the risk/reward profile cannot be properly quantified for institutional position sizing.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective, focusing on the key decision factors:
