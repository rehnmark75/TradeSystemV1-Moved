Claude Enhanced Analysis

Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Critical market context and technical confirmation data is absent, making institutional-grade risk assessment impossible despite the high system confidence. The London/NY overlap timing is favorable, but entering a major pair position without clear regime analysis, momentum indicators, or key level context violates institutional risk protocols. The 85% system confidence appears disconnected from available technical evidence.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I must note several concerning elements about this signal that require careful consideration.

The 85% system confidence appears disconnected from available technical evidence.

Additional Professional Note: While the liquidity profile during the session overlap is attractive, institutional capital deployment requires substantially more validation, particularly around key resistance/support levels and current market structure which are notably missing from this analysis.
