Claude Enhanced Analysis
Generated: 2025-08-15 11:05:10
Epic: CS.D.GBPUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BULL
Price: 1.356205
Strategy: EMA
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 7/10
Decision: APPROVE
Approved: True
Reason: Strong technical setup with price above all EMAs and perfect alignment, supported by high volume (497.0) indicating institutional participation. While MACD shows relatively weak momentum (0.000030), the favorable position within the range (59% from support) combined with London session liquidity provides good risk/reward structure for a bullish position. Key caution is the low ATR (0.00053) suggesting potential for slower price development, but risk can be managed with the clearly defined support at 1.35208.
