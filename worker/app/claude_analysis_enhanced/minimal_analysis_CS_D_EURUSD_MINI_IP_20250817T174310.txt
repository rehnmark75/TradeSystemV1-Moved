Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the signal shows high system confidence (85%) and optimal liquidity conditions during NY session, there's insufficient technical context provided for proper institutional position sizing and risk assessment. Critical elements missing include key support/resistance levels, momentum indicators, and broader market regime analysis which are essential for institutional capital deployment. The lack of clear risk parameters and technical confluence points makes this setup suboptimal from a risk-adjusted return perspective.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional perspective:
