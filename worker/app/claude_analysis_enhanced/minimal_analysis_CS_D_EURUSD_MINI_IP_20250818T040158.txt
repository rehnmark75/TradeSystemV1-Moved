Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 4/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Entry signal during Tokyo session lacks sufficient momentum validation and presents suboptimal timing given expected volatility patterns. System confidence of 85% is undermined by absence of critical market regime data and lack of defined support/resistance levels. Risk/reward profile appears unfavorable without clear technical confluence points or defined market structure context.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I'll evaluate this signal through an institutional lens:

SCORE: 4/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Entry signal during Tokyo session lacks sufficient momentum validation and presents suboptimal timing given expected volatility patterns. System confidence of 85% is undermined by absence of critical market regime data and lack of defined support/resistance levels. Risk/reward profile appears unfavorable without clear technical confluence points or defined market structure context.

Note: Without key technical indicators (momentum, trend structure, key price levels) and broader market regime analysis, this signal lacks the institutional-grade validation parameters required for confident capital deployment during lower-liquidity conditions.
