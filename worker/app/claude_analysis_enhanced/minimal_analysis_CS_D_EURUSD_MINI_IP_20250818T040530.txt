Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 3/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: Signal lacks critical technical validation metrics (no momentum indicators, support/resistance levels, or clear market structure analysis) during the typically thin Tokyo session. The 85% system confidence appears arbitrary without corroborating evidence, and entry timing preceding the London/NY overlap raises execution risk. Additionally, insufficient risk parameters (no defined stop-loss or take-profit levels) make proper position sizing and risk/reward assessment impossible.

Raw Response:
As a senior forex analyst, I must highlight significant concerns with this signal:

SCORE: 3/10
DECISION: REJECT
REASON: Signal lacks critical technical validation metrics (no momentum indicators, support/resistance levels, or clear market structure analysis) during the typically thin Tokyo session. The 85% system confidence appears arbitrary without corroborating evidence, and entry timing preceding the London/NY overlap raises execution risk. Additionally, insufficient risk parameters (no defined stop-loss or take-profit levels) make proper position sizing and risk/reward assessment impossible.

The absence of market regime context and comprehensive technical analysis makes this signal unsuitable for institutional capital deployment, despite being on a major pair. Professional capital allocation requires substantially more validation points and clearly defined risk parameters.
