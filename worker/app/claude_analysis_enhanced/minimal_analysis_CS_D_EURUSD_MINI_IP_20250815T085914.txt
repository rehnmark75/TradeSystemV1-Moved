Epic: CS.D.EURUSD.MINI.IP
Signal: BUY
Price: 1.1234
Strategy: UNKNOWN
Technical Validation: PASSED

CLAUDE DECISION:
Score: 6/10
Decision: REJECT
Approved: False
Reason: While the London/NY overlap timing is optimal for EUR/USD liquidity, the signal lacks critical technical context including momentum indicators, key level analysis, and broader market regime data required for institutional position-taking. The 85% system confidence is notable but insufficient without corroborating price structure confirmation and clear invalidation levels for risk management. Given the significant liquidity events during overlap sessions, more technical confirmation is needed to justify capital deployment.

Raw Response:
Let me analyze this from an institutional trading perspective:
