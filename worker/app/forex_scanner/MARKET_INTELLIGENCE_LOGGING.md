# Market Intelligence Logging Enhancement

## 📊 Overview

Enhanced logging has been added to provide comprehensive visibility into market intelligence capture across all strategies. This allows you to analyze market conditions in real-time during scanner operations.

## 🔍 Logging Levels Added

### **1. TradeValidator Level Logging** (`core/trading/trade_validator.py`)

**When Intelligence is Captured:**
```
🧠 Capturing market intelligence context for EURUSD (ema_crossover strategy)
📊 EURUSD: Market intelligence captured - Regime: trending (82%), Session: london, Volatility: high
```

**When Intelligence Already Exists:**
```
📊 EURUSD: Market intelligence already present in signal, skipping capture
```

**When Intelligence Unavailable:**
```
⚠️ EURUSD: Failed to get market intelligence report
```

### **2. Scanner Level Summary** (`core/scanner.py`)

**Market Intelligence Summary per Scan:**
```
📊 Market Intelligence Summary:
   🧠 Strategies with intelligence: ema_crossover, macd_divergence, ichimoku
   📈 Market Regimes: trending(2), ranging(1) | Avg Confidence: 78%

### **Market Conditions**
- Current market regime (trending, ranging, breakout, reversal)
- Confidence level in regime detection
- Trading session activity (Asian, London, New York)
- Volatility conditions (high, medium, low)

### **Intelligence Quality**
- Average confidence across all signals
- Distribution of regimes and sessions
- Source of intelligence (strategy-specific vs universal)

### **Real-time Analysis**
- See market conditions as they happen
- Correlate signal quality with market regimes
- Identify optimal trading sessions for strategies

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Enable/Disable Market Intelligence Logging**

The logging automatically appears when:
- `ENABLE_MARKET_INTELLIGENCE_CAPTURE = True` (default)
- Market Intelligence Engine is available
- Signals are being generated

### **Log Levels**
- **INFO**: Main intelligence capture and summaries
- **DEBUG**: Detailed intelligence processing
- **WARNING**: Failures and fallbacks

## 📊 Using the Data for Analysis

### **Identify Optimal Conditions**
```bash
# grep for trending regimes
grep "Market Regimes: trending" scanner.log

# grep for high volatility sessions
grep "Volatility Levels: high" scanner.log

# grep for specific strategy intelligence
grep "ema_crossover strategy" scanner.log
```

### **Track Intelligence Coverage**
```bash
# Count universal vs strategy-specific captures
grep "Intelligence Sources:" scanner.log | sort | uniq -c

# Track regime distribution over time
grep "Market Regimes:" scanner.log | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c
```

### **Performance Analysis**
- Compare signal success rates during different regimes
- Identify best-performing strategies per session
- Correlate volatility levels with strategy effectiveness

## 🚀 Production Benefits
