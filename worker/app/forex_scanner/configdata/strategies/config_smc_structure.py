SMC Structure Strategy Configuration
Pure structure-based trading using Smart Money Concepts

Strategy Overview:
1. Identify HTF trend (4H structure - HH/HL or LH/LL)
2. Wait for pullback to S/R level
3. Confirm rejection pattern (pin bar, engulfing, etc.)
4. Enter with structure (not indicators)
5. Stop beyond structure (invalidation point)
6. Target next structure level (supply/demand zone)

Design Philosophy:
- No lagging indicators (MACD, RSI, etc.)
- Pure price action and structure
- Institutional logic (where smart money operates)
- Clear structure-based invalidation
- Bot-friendly deterministic rules
